            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="display-6">I</span>ntelligent software systems that act as human tutors in real time, providing individualized instruction, constructive feedback, and learner support, are called AI tutors. These systems use artificial intelligence to evaluate a student’s progress, identify learning gaps, and modify content accordingly. The AI used in personalized learning platforms differs from that in AI tutors; whereas personalized learning platforms attempt to create a learning environment in which each student masters concepts, the AI tutor provides a working digital teacher that guides students in mastering concepts through an interactive and adaptive dialogue <i>(Holmes et al., 2019)</i>.
            </p>
              
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Traditionally, tuition has mostly focused on personal teaching assistance made available by a professional human tutor, which in general limits time, cost, and location. AI tutors, on the other hand, are omni-present and can provide their services to hundreds of students at the same time. Furthermore, the real-time feedback and continuous assessment these tutors provide are the kind of things that human tutors can hardly manage to maintain consistently. Additionally, AI tutors can somehow, in no time, adapt to the requirements of a student, unlike the conventional models that usually need extensive planning and observation <i>(Luckin et al., 2016)</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the idea of AI tutors emerged with the first Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). The focus of these early systems was diction, therefore mimicking expert human tutoring behaviors. When computing and data analytic power improved, AI tutors matured into more interactive systems employing natural language processing and real-time feedback. Modern AI tutors rely on deep learning and educational psychology, giving rise to MATHia from Carnegie Learning or Watson Tutor from IBM <i>(Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019)</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              AI tutors are gaining importance in correcting the existing inequities in education since traditional instruction was very much in the limelight during the COVID-19 pandemic. In under-resourced schools, these AI tutors might aid human teachers in providing personalized assistance to those deserving attention but not receiving enough of it. In addition to that, AI tutors help in providing continuity and support to students in various environments, thereby helping to democratize access to good-quality education.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              The working mechanism of AI tutors is the same as for that of human tutor- teaching, questioning, explaining, and assessing. The AI monitors student responses to detect misconceptions, providing relevant hints, questions, or explanations. This type of system also observes learning pathways and adapts its instructive action in time, allowing the student not only to memorize but also to understand on a deeper level <i>(Holmes et al., 2019)</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              AI tutors rely on various technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), knowledge tracing, and rule-based reasoning. With NLP, these systems can understand the student's input and respond in a conversational manner, while machine learning helps them predict what students will do in the future. Common techniques for modeling student learning over time are Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and Deep Knowledge Tracing <i>(Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019).</i>
            </p> 
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              AI tutors execute tasks such as diagnosing a problem, generating exper­iences, providing solutions step-by-step, adjusting the difficulty of a lesson, and giving immediate corrective feedback. They can simulate Socratic dialogue to provoke critical thinking or scaffold complex concepts by breaking these down into manageable chunks. In the STEM domain, for instance, AI tutors can walk students through interactive processes involving math equations or coding syntax, thereby accomplishing the same goal as a real tutor <i>(Luckin et al., 2016)</i>.
            </p> 
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              The human aspect of an instructor leads to feelings of empathy, emotional encouragement, and layered forms of communication in the learning experience. On the other hand, AI tutors are much more scalable, consistent, and available 24/7. They are capable of processing large quantities of data on a learning subject and making instant decisions based on it, something humans would find difficult to manage on such a scale. In the blended learning setting, it has been found that the combination of AI tutoring with human oversight enhances engagement and performance compared to either strategy by itself <i>(Pane et al., 2015)</i>.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              AI tutors are used all over K-12 and higher education around the world. MATHia from Carnegie Learning, for example, is used in U.S. classrooms to provide adaptive math instruction. In China, Squirrel AI provides thousands of students with an AI-dependent tutoring mechanism that adapts to their individual learning gaps. Similarly, in higher education, ALEKS is an AI-supported mathematical program used for testing and skill-building purposes. These tools have helped improve completion rates and capabilities in examinations <i>(Holmes et al., 2019)</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Examples of popular AI tutoring platforms are MATHia (Carnegie Learning), Socratic by Google, Khanmigo (by Khan Academy), Squirrel AI, and Querium. Each adopts a diversified amalgamation of AI technologies to accomplish real-time tutoring. For instance, Khanmigo incorporates GPT-powered dialogue to help students delve deep into topics, while MATHia lays emphasis on mastery learning through problem-solving in an AI-adaptive manner <i>(Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019</i>).
            </p> 
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Another significant success story features Carnegie Learning; the company announced a great increase in student math scores and engagement in schools that adopted MATHia. In China, on the other hand, Squirrel AI demonstrated enhancements in student retention and exam scores across various regions, even exceeding human tutors in some cases. These examples prove that, if thoughtfully employed, AI tutors can at times rival or even outperform traditional tutoring in certain respects <i>(Luckin et al., 2016)</i>.
            </p> 
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              The three countries are China, the U.S., and South Korea, which are top-ranking countries in the AI tutor development and deployment. The AI tutoring area is heavily invested in China's EdTech with platforms such as Squirrel AI and TAL Education. In the U.S., for example, there are universities such as Arizona State and Stanford that today are using AI tutoring tools for math and writing support. There is also South Korea pioneering the development of AI tutors for language learning as part of its digital education initiative <i>(Holmes et al., 2019)</i>.
