            its developments and applications would meet established principles of human rights thus, avoid discrimination and
            safeguard the freedoms of everyone. Just as having AI systems directly integrated into our lives becomes, greater and
            stricter concern must be trained upward because their inevitable biases and misuse can infringe upon many of such
            rights. The speed and reach of operation, able to be performed by these AIs, complicate societal condition possibilities
            and do intensify the ebb-and-flow inequalities across societies. This issue has caught a lot of people's attention with
            rapid growth in AI technology and widespread awareness of the real-world risks caused by algorithmic bias toward unfair
            results and AI intrusion surveillance <em>(Risk Management Profile for Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, 2025)</em>.
            </p>
              
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AI has imparted fresh dimensions to the human rights landscape through its use of unique capabilities. AI, unlike
              traditional decision-making for humans, can manipulate massive data at great speed and extent, which can radically
              affect the rights of individuals. The lack of transparency of certain AI algorithms can make it hard to follow their
              decision-making process, deterring accountability and the means to tackle possible violations of human rights. Not less
              threatening to privacy rights and personal autonomy is the ability of AI to operate covertly and surreptitiously at
              level force-filling-scale-like surveillance.
            </p>

            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days, more and more focus has been put on the intersection between AI and human rights, primarily due to a handful
              of important factors. With fast-paced developments in AI technology and its ever-wider deployment in key sectors, the
              calls of potential risks suddenly came to the forefront <em>(Getting the Future Right – Artificial Intelligence and
              Fundamental Rights, 2024)</em>. Human rights can be viewed as being under dire threat when actual instances of algorithmic
              bias come out into the open, and especially with deep concerns generated by AI-powered misinformation. The awareness of
              these challenges has increased, and regulatory scrutiny is becoming more pronounced, thereby creating an urgent need for
              developing proactive frameworks to protect human rights in the context of AI.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              AI has both sides in regard to human rights; it can become a source of problems or possibly a solution. Human rights
              abuses can be occasioned by biased algorithms that carry societal inequalities into account, such as in hiring or in
              criminal justice <em>(O'Neil, 2016)</em>. In such scenarios, the operation of the AI decision-making processes lacks
              transparency, rendering it difficult to pinpoint as well as contest the biases. AI surveillance technologies attack the
              user's right to privacy and freedom of expression.
            </p> 
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              On the other hand, there is a plethora of opportunities offered by AI to address and perhaps even solve certain
              challenges in human rights. AI can assess massive datasets to look for patterns of abuse and to potentially prevent
              future violations <em>(Amnesty International, 2024)</em>; it can be used to enhance accessibility for persons with disabilities
              and promote their participation in society. AI could also expedite the processes involved in human rights monitoring and
              reporting by allowing organizations to better prepare their data.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              The other social ramifications of AI on human rights are multifaceted. Workers may be subjected to biased AI systems for
              hiring and performance assessment, which can, in return, hold grave hazards for their livelihood. Students can find
              AI-implemented educational platforms with possible data privacy concerns. As AI becomes more integrated into law
              enforcement, citizens will have newer considerations with either better services or new forms of discrimination
              depending on how it is used.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              Certain AI technologies are very much involved in human rights considerations. Obviously, facial recognition technology
              poses serious concerns about privacy and mass surveillance, possibly affecting the freedom of assembly. With LLMs, we
              can spread disinformation and generate biased content. Algorithmic decision-making systems, in use across sectors, can
              enhance existing social biases leading to discriminatory outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              The effectiveness and possible biases of these AI technologies are predicated primarily on their key data used. The use
              of biometrics such as facial images for identification has surveillance implications, and raise questions concerning
              data protection <em>(ACLU, n.d.)</em>. User behavior data collected online can be used for profiling, giving rise to privacy
              concerns. Sensitive data like health records seem to demand the strongest protection from discrimination <em>(HIPAA Journal,
              n.d.)</em>.
            </p> 
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              These problems are human rights problems, found in AI-enabled tools and platforms- social media algorithms are
              characterized as possible propagate misinformation, as well as create echo chambers. On the other hand, law enforcement
              agencies use facial recognition and predictive policing, which raises issues over due process. AI-integrated human
              resources software would lead to biased hiring decisions. These problems shine a big light on the urgency the world
              faces regarding the implications of human rights due to these extensive applications of AI.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              Citing a few real-life examples, the challenges faced in the implementation of AI with respect to human rights are
              further emphasized. In some regions, massive facial recognition systems have given rise to concern over the erosion of
              privacy and freedom of assembly. Bias in algorithms in hiring tools has worked adversely against certain demographic
              groups. AI-generated misinformation has the potential to erode the democratic process.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Various European initiatives are recognizable and highlight the European way of thinking and its implications for human
              rights in AI. The European Commission defines such an approach as human-centered and ethical, ensuring that AI develops
              by serving peoples' interests, respecting their rights and values <em>(European Approach to Artificial Intelligence, n.d.)</em>.
              Some areas of concern include fairness in AI systems, safety, and transparency. Looking ahead, the proposed AI Act aims
              to set up an extensive legal regime for AI use; this regime would operate on a classification of risk levels, with
              especially strict provisions applying to applications posing high risk to fundamental rights <em>(European Approach to
              Artificial Intelligence, n.d.)</em>. This is not an enforcement mechanism-but the drift of this regime is one of proactive
              enforcement to ensure AI technologies will be developed and utilized in a manner consistent with human rights principles
              in Europe.
            </p> 
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Differences between developed and developing countries in the way they deal with AI and human rights are remarkable.
              Developed nations usually have stronger technological infrastructure and legal frameworks to address the issue of AI
              with human rights. Developing countries may have to contend with problems in their digital infrastructure, as well as
              little or no capacity to effectively monitor AI risks <em>(Technology and Innovation Report, n.d.)</em>. This indicates the
              importance of international cooperation and support.
